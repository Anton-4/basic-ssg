## Reads the given environment variable and attempts to decode it.
##
## The type being decoded into will be determined by type inference. For example,
## if this ends up being used like a `Task U16 _` then the environment variable
## will be decoded as a string representation of a `U16`. Trying to decode into
## any other type will fail with a `DecodeErr`.
##
## Supported types include;
## - Strings,
## - Numbers, as long as they contain only numeric digits, up to one `.`, and an optional `-` at the front for negative numbers, and
## - Comma-separated lists (of either strings or numbers), as long as there are no spaces after the commas.
##
## For example, consider we want to decode the environment variable `NUM_THINGS`;
##
## ```
## # Reads "NUM_THINGS" and decodes into a U16
## getU16Var : Str -> Task U16 [VarNotFound, DecodeErr DecodeError] [Read [Env]]
## getU16Var = \var -> Env.decode! var
## ```
##
## If `NUM_THINGS=123` then `getU16Var` succeeds with the value of `123u16`.
## However if `NUM_THINGS=123456789`, then `getU16Var` will
## fail with [DecodeErr](https://www.roc-lang.org/builtins/Decode#DecodeError)
## because `123456789` is too large to fit in a [U16](https://www.roc-lang.org/builtins/Num#U16).
